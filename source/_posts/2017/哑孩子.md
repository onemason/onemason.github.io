孩子在找寻他的声音。
(把它带走的是蟋蟀的王。)
在一滴水中
孩子在找寻他的声音。

我不是要他来说话，
我要把它做个指环，
让我的缄默
戴在他纤小的指头上。

在一滴水中
孩子在找寻他的声音。
(被俘在远方的声音，穿上了蟋蟀的衣裳。)

**The Little Mute Boy**

*The little boy was looking for his voice.
(The King of the crickets had it.)
In a drop of water
the little boy was looking for his voice.*

*I do not want it for speaking with;
I will make a ring of it
so that he may wear my silence
on his little finger.*

*In a drop of water
the little boy was looking for his voice.
(The captive voice, far away,
put on a cricket' clothes.)*
