*Here’s to the crazy ones
The misfits, the rebels, the troublemakers, the round pegs in the square holes
The ones who see things differently
They are not fond of rules
And they have no respect for the status quo
You can quote them,disagree  with them, glorify or vilify them
About the only thing you can’t do is ignore them
Because they change things
They push the human race forward
And some may see them as the crazy ones,we see genius
Because the people who are crazy enough to think they can change the world are the ones who do*
